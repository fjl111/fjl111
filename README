I am a senior computer engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I am extremely hardworking, not only in my classes but also in the 2 clubs I participate in, Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) and Habitat for Humanity. In FSAE I hone my skills in Python, C, Javascript, SQL, Azure cloud management, Altium Design, and SMD PCB soldering. I gained some of these electronics skills from my internship at Planet Networks in 2021 where I built and configured desktop computers, repaired and optimized laptops, and updated network switch firmware. I also studied engineering in high school where I designed and constructed an autonomous robot to salt driveways. This project taught me to construct and troubleshoot complex electrical circuits, code on Arduino, utilize internet protocols to communicate between devices, design and test in SOLIDWORKS and present a finished project.


As a member of Habitat for Humanity and employee of Appalachia Service Project, I satisfy my desire to help others by providing high quality home repair service. In Habitat for Humanity I coordinate with 4 different organizations to plan weekly home repair projects for the club. At Appalachia Service Project I managed construction projects at 14 different homes and helped coordinate over 400 volunteers.


I am passionate to make a positive impact on the world and wish to become a key contributor on a team at an innovative technology company where I can help design products that improve people's quality of life.
